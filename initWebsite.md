I'm gonna try out Lektor - lektor init

After initialized :
$ cd [projectFolder]
$ lektor server
localhost:5000

Cool - it created a simple lektor server and then I built it
$ lektor build

Next steps today :
+ create a github pages - hamandtomatoe.github.io
+ error page set up	
+ portfolio guide set up

Currently : running into issues with creating a github pages
I think I github only allows uers to host one pages - using my username @ <username>.github.io
I also received an email from github stating there was a failed workflow

I am done for today. I messed up the local repo and had to reinit... Kind of understood github a bit more ngl

Happy new year!

After browsing a couple of static site generators, I came across Lektor [ https://www.getlektor.com ].
It's a static site generator and content management system, seems like a pretty small project.

I also came across this blog [ http://yummymelon.com/devnull/administering-macports.html ],
which linked to [ https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/ ].
I decided to download macports instead of homebrew, which I didn't know was package manager / I could choose

Trying to create a website Dec 30, 2024

I am trying to create a website under the name hamandtomatoe
It's a moniker I've been using on instagram for a few years now, but I've always had iffyness about using instagram.
Plus, now with AI and however meta will be using people's pictures and information to feed into their AI - it's scary. 
This reminds me:
**read meta's privacy policy**

So I'm trying to create this website through github's hosting. 
Starting off with html and css, before adding javascript and I was reading stuff on php + xml,
which seems more backend + transfer of data, respectively.

I'm using a refurbished 13-in macbook air from 2017. 
It's still the intel core i5 chip - 1.8 GHz dual-core; 8 GB memory - 1699 MHz ddr3. 
It's running macos monterey v 12.7.6 - which is probably the last version of macos that can run on this macbook air. 
And I'm not sure if apple still maintains / supports it, or if it's considered legacy now.

But because of this, homebrew isn't supported... I believe. 
Which came to be because I was trying to install git and didn't realize the prompt popped up.
Retrying to install it today, an dialog box popped up after the terminal displayed this :

cat@ys-MacBook-Air ~ % git
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
cat@ys-MacBook-Air ~ % 

and now, it's installing. Macos does make things pretty straightforward for it's users. I've already installed vscode,
so after this installs, I should be able to create a repo with git that will become the hamandtomatoe website.

Git is installed! Next steps:
create github repo - hamandtomatoe : apparently already done
clone to 
vscode : debating because I need to give vscode access to my github account...
terminal : better? separation of resources
find open source html framework?...
find open source css

Why : I wanna make this webpage my portfolio... maybe only of artstuff. Or maybe as a test
